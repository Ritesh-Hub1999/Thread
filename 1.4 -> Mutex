MUTEX : Mutual Exclusion

mutex is used on race condition

RACE CONDITION:
-------------
0. Race condition is a situation
   where two or more threads/process
   happens to change a common data at
   the same time.
   
1. If there is a race condition then we
   have to protect it and the protected 
   section is  called critical section/region.

MUTEX:
0. Mutex is used to avoid race condition.
1. We use lock() , unlock() on mutex to 
   avoid race condition.
   
CODE:
----
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
using namespace std;

int data = 0;
mutex m;
void func1(){
    m.lock();
    ++data;
    m.unlock();
}

int main()
{
    thread t1(func1);
    thread t2(func1);
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    cout<<data<<endl;
    
}

1.1-> try_lock() On Mutex 
      ---------
0. try_lock() Tries to lock the mutex. 
   Returns immediately. On successful
   lock acquisition returns true otherwise
   returns false.
   
1. If try_lock() is not able to lock mutex,
   then it doesn't get blocked that's why 
   it is called non-blocking.
   
2. If try_lock is called again by the same
   thread which owns the mutex, the behaviour
   is undefined.It is a dead lock situation 
   with undefined behaviour.
   
Code:
----
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
using namespace std;

int counter = 0;
mutex m;

void increaseTheCounterBy100Time(){
    for(int i=0;i<100;i++){
        if(m.try_lock()){
            ++counter;
            m.unlock();
        }
    }
}

int main(){
    thread t1(increaseTheCounterBy100Time);
    thread t2(increaseTheCounterBy100Time);
    
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    
    cout<<counter;
}

Time_Mutex:
----------
timed_mutex is blocked till timeout_time
or the lock is acquired and returns true
if success otherwise false.

code:
----
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <chrono>
using namespace std;

int counter = 0;
timed_mutex m;

void print(int i){
    if(m.try_lock_for(chrono::seconds(1))){
        counter++;
        this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::seconds(2));
        cout<<"THread " << i <<" Entered" <<endl;
        m.unlock();
    }
    else{
        cout<<"THread "<< i <<" couldn't enter"<<endl;
    }
}


int main(){
   thread t1(print,1);
   thread t2(print,2);
   t1.join();
   t2.join();
   
   cout<<counter;
}

Recursive Mutex
---------------
1. If thread T1 first call lock/try_lock on
recursive mutex m1, then m1 is locked by 
T1, now as T1 is running in recursion T1
can call lock/try_lock any number of times
there is no issue.

2. But if T1 have acquired 10 times lock/try_lock
on mutex m1 then thread T1 will have to unlock 
it 10 times otherwise no other thread will be
able to lock mutex m1.
It means recursive_mutex keeps count how many
times it was locked so that many times it should
be unlocked.

Code:
----
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <chrono>
using namespace std;

int counter = 0;
recursive_mutex m;

void recursion(char ch, int n){
    if(n < 0){
        return;
    }
    m.lock();
    cout<<"thread ID" << ch <<" "<<counter++<<endl;
    recursion(ch,n-1);
    m.unlock();
    
}

int main(){
   thread t1(recursion,'1',10);
   thread t2(recursion,'2',10);
   
   t1.join();
   t2.join();

}
