When interviewing candidates for positions that involve working with thread pools, you can ask a mix of conceptual, practical, and technical questions to assess their understanding and skills. Here are some key questions you might consider:

### Conceptual Questions

1. **What is a thread pool, and why is it used?**
A thread pool is a collection of pre-initialized 
threads that can be reused to perform multiple 
tasks. It is used to manage a pool of worker
 threads, improving performance and resource
 utilization by reusing threads instead of 
creating new ones for each task.

2. Can you explain the lifecycle of a thread in a thread pool?**
 The lifecycle includes thread creation, 
execution, waiting for tasks, performing
 tasks, and eventually termination 
when the pool is shut down.

3. **What are the advantages and disadvantages 
of using thread pools?**
 Advantages include reduced latency in task 
execution, better resource management

Disadvantages might include complexity in 
implementation
