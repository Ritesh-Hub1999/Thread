When interviewing candidates for positions that involve working with thread pools, you can ask a mix of conceptual, practical, and technical questions to assess their understanding and skills. Here are some key questions you might consider:

### Conceptual Questions

1. **What is a thread pool, and why is it used?**
A thread pool is a collection of pre-initialized 
threads that can be reused to perform multiple 
tasks. It is used to manage a pool of worker
 threads, improving performance and resource
 utilization by reusing threads instead of 
creating new ones for each task.

2. Can you explain the lifecycle of a thread in a thread pool?**
 The lifecycle includes thread creation, 
execution, waiting for tasks, performing
 tasks, and eventually termination 
when the pool is shut down.

3. **What are the advantages and disadvantages 
of using thread pools?**
 Advantages include reduced latency in task 
execution, better resource management

Disadvantages might include complexity in 
implementation

Types Of thread Pool:
------------------
1. Fixed Thread Pool
A fixed thread pool creates a specific number
of threads at initialization, which remains 
constant throughout the pool's lifetime. This 
type of pool is useful when the workload is 
predictable and the number of threads needed 
is known in advance.

2. Cached Thread Pool
A cached thread pool creates new threads as 
needed but will reuse previously constructed 
threads when they are available. If a thread 
remains idle for a certain period, it may be 
terminated. This type of pool is suitable for 
applications with many short-lived tasks.

3. Single Thread Executor
This type of thread pool uses a single worker 
thread to execute all tasks sequentially. It 
ensures that tasks are executed in the order 
they are submitted and is useful for maintaining 
task sequence and thread safety without the 
complexity of managing multiple threads.

4. Scheduled Thread Pool
A scheduled thread pool is designed to execute
tasks after a given delay or periodically. It
is commonly used for tasks that need to be 
executed at regular intervals or after a delay.

Example Of thread POOls:
// C++ Program to demonstrate thread pooling 

#include <condition_variable> 
#include <functional> 
#include <iostream> 
#include <mutex> 
#include <queue> 
#include <thread> 
using namespace std; 

// Class that represents a simple thread pool 
class ThreadPool { 
public: 
	// // Constructor to creates a thread pool with given 
	// number of threads 
	ThreadPool(size_t num_threads 
			= thread::hardware_concurrency()) 
	{ 

		// Creating worker threads 
		for (size_t i = 0; i < num_threads; ++i) { 
			threads_.emplace_back([this] { 
				while (true) { 
					function<void()> task; 
					// The reason for putting the below code 
					// here is to unlock the queue before 
					// executing the task so that other 
					// threads can perform enqueue tasks 
					{ 
						// Locking the queue so that data 
						// can be shared safely 
						unique_lock<mutex> lock( 
							queue_mutex_); 

						// Waiting until there is a task to 
						// execute or the pool is stopped 
						cv_.wait(lock, [this] { 
							return !tasks_.empty() || stop_; 
						}); 

						// exit the thread in case the pool 
						// is stopped and there are no tasks 
						if (stop_ && tasks_.empty()) { 
							return; 
						} 

						// Get the next task from the queue 
						task = move(tasks_.front()); 
						tasks_.pop(); 
					} 

					task(); 
				} 
			}); 
		} 
	} 

	// Destructor to stop the thread pool 
	~ThreadPool() 
	{ 
		{ 
			// Lock the queue to update the stop flag safely 
			unique_lock<mutex> lock(queue_mutex_); 
			stop_ = true; 
		} 

		// Notify all threads 
		cv_.notify_all(); 

		// Joining all worker threads to ensure they have 
		// completed their tasks 
		for (auto& thread : threads_) { 
			thread.join(); 
		} 
	} 

	// Enqueue task for execution by the thread pool 
	void enqueue(function<void()> task) 
	{ 
		{ 
			unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queue_mutex_); 
			tasks_.emplace(move(task)); 
		} 
		cv_.notify_one(); 
	} 

private: 
	// Vector to store worker threads 
	vector<thread> threads_; 

	// Queue of tasks 
	queue<function<void()> > tasks_; 

	// Mutex to synchronize access to shared data 
	mutex queue_mutex_; 

	// Condition variable to signal changes in the state of 
	// the tasks queue 
	condition_variable cv_; 

	// Flag to indicate whether the thread pool should stop 
	// or not 
	bool stop_ = false; 
}; 

int main() 
{ 
	// Create a thread pool with 4 threads 
	ThreadPool pool(4); 

	// Enqueue tasks for execution 
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) { 
		pool.enqueue([i] { 
			cout << "Task " << i << " is running on thread "
				<< this_thread::get_id() << endl; 
			// Simulate some work 
			this_thread::sleep_for( 
				chrono::milliseconds(100)); 
		}); 
	} 

	return 0; 
}
