JOIN NOTES
-------
0. Once a thread is started we wait 
   for this thread to finish by calling
   join() function on thread object.
   
1. Double join will result into program 
   termination.
   
2. If needed we should check thread is
    joinable before joining. ( using 
    joinable() function)

DETACH NOTES:
------------
0. This is used to detach newly created
   thread from the parent thread.
   
1. If we have detached thread and main 
   function is returning then the detached
   thread execution is suspended.
   
2. Always check before detaching a thread
   that it is joinable otherwise we may 
   end up double detaching and double 
   detach() will result into 
   program termination.

#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
using namespace std;

void func(){
    cout<<"I'M in func"<<endl;
    this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::seconds(5));
}
int main()
{
    thread t(func);
    t.detach();
    cout<<"main() function end"<<endl;
    
}
